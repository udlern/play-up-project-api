# Play Up!

## Pitch:
Ever wanted to have an easy way to organize a pick up game of any and all sports of your liking with people who live close by??
Enter...Play Up!, the app that allows you to connect with people who share the same sporty interests and who are looking for the opportunity to make friends and play the games they love :)

## User Deliverables:
#### As a user, I can sign up, login, and logout
#### As a user, I can view all players/users on the app and follow the ones I want
#### As a user, I can look for a game depending on what type of sport I want to play and the location that the game specified, and then add the game to my list (BONUS: will only show games that have a location that is a certain range that I choose to filter it by)
#### As a user, I can create a game (BONUS: and invite other players that I follow to this game)
#### As a user, I can view all of the players I follow and the games I've added
#### As a user, I can view and comment on the games that I've added to my list on the discussion board
